Code review notes that we have completed or are in the process of completing.

- Pygame.time, there were a bit confusion on this this part of the code for the audience: Added comments to clear this up.

- There were also a bit confused on what .unicode does.  So, maybe a better explanation for that: Added comments to clear this up.

- One of the import thing to look at was what Dr. Crain mentioned about the Doc-string, that it’s supposed to tell you how to use the class, and how it works. But, yours does not do that. Think about fixing that: Working on this one.

- Advice was to split up your codes so is not all packed in one place, also think about putting in comments next to the codes, just to label what each part does. Might make it easier for others to understand: Have split up the code into multiple files, and have added more comments.

- One person mentioned they didn’t like the pygame window that much, so maybe think about changing it: Changed the pygame window to read Trumpocalypse! Instead of pygame.

-Change the menu for the heath, it doesn't seem right. Make it more noticeable, with color or boldness: Made the health red in color and made the health increase in size as you lose health.
